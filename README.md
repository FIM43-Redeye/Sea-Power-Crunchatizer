# Sea-Power-Crunchatizer
A simple MelonLoader cheat mod. Plug-and-play, config explains everything.

# Installation
1) Download the MelonLoader Installer: https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases
2) Run it to install MelonLoader onto Sea Power.
3) Place the .dll file in the Mods folder in your game's root.

# Configuration
In the UserData folder, edit the MelonPreferences.cfg file.

# Known Issues
The shared launch delay for ships can be altered, but engagement timing seems to still respect it, at least if the delay is one second. I'm not sure how to resolve this; if you have ideas, make an issue or a PR.

If you want any new features, ask me, or better yet, make a PR. If I don't like the idea I won't implement it myself, but if it's in a PR I'll almost certainly do it.
